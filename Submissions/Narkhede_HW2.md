### Forecasts are based on the of streamflow trends observed in the past. The stream flow trend shown by plots plotted using python program shows gradually increasing streamflow from the month of September to December for most of the years records in the past. Some fluctuations were noted in the late November and early December, these fluctuations might not have any effect on streamflow in the month of September. Last weeks's forecast was apparently overestimated, so the reduced forecast this week would make more sense.
