## Describe the variables flow, year, month, and day. What type of objects are they, what are they composed of, and how long are they?
#### flow: This variable indicates daily streamflow at the study location. Its a "list" with variable type "float". The length of this variable is 11578 showing streamflow record for period 01/01/1989 to 09/12/2020.
#### year: This variable indicates the year of the streamflow records at the study location. Its a "list" with variable type "int". The length of this variable is 11578 showing year of streamflow record for period 01/01/1989 to 09/12/2020.
#### month: This variable indicates the month of the streamflow records at the study location. Its a "list" with variable type "int". The length of this variable is 11578 showing month of streamflow record for period 01/01/1989 to 09/12/2020.
#### day: This variable indicates the day of the streamflow records at the study location. Its a "list" with variable type "int". The length of this variable is 11578 showing day of streamflow record for period 01/01/1989 to 09/12/2020.

## How many times was the daily flow greater than your prediction in the month of September (express your answer in terms of the total number of times and as a percentage)?
#### The daily flow was greater than the mean weekly predicted flow (62 cfs) twice in the month of September in 2020. As a percentage it exceeded 16.66% of the times.The average percent exceedance in streamflow was 3.709 %
#### For entire period of records from 1989 - 2020, the daily streamflow was greater than predicted flow 883 times. As a percentage it exceeded 97.73% of the times. The average percent exceedance in streamflow was 194.24%. This indicates daily streamflows in September had very large values of streamflows than 62 cfs.

## How would your answer to the previous question change if you considered only daily flows in or before 2000? Same question for the flows in or after the year 2010? (again report total number of times and percentage)
#### If only daily flows before 2000 were considered, streamflows were greater than predicted streamflow 330 times. Percent times daily streamflow exceeded than prediction from 1989 - 2020 was 100% (indicates all records were > 62 cfs). On an average flows were 250% greater than 62 cfs, highest being greater than 5000 cfs in 1999 and in 2004.
#### For records in or after 2010, 279 times flow was greater than prediction which was 89.42% times. On average flows were 133.58% greater than current prediction.

## How does the daily flow generally change from the first half of September to the second?
#### The trend of change seemed to be varying. Mostly, first half of September has higher flows than second half. In some cases, second half contained second flow peak, first peak being in first half of the month. Flows tend to reduces towards the end of first half and tends to increases again in the second half.
