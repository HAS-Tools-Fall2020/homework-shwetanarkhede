# Homework #11-Group coding


## Forecast Approach
To forecast this week, we took a divide and conquer approach. As a group we each went over each member's forecasting script to decide which we wanted to use. We then repeated this process for the map, using the gallery to decide whos map we wanted to utilize and any changes that we as a group wanted to make.

## Division of labor
As part of the assignment, we divided our work in the following way: Shweta saw to the forecast script, Alcely created the graphs, Richard took care of making our map, and Scott did the writing for this week's assignment.
