## **Assignment Questions**

1. **What resources did you request on Ocelote? How long did you wait in the queue for your job to run and how long did it take to run?**

 I requested the resources suggested by you, 1 core and 1 node and used 10 minutes of running time. It hardly took few seconds to get the job done as script was simple and short.

2. **What was the most confusing part to you about setting up and running your job on Ocelote?**

I failed to setup .pbs file couple of times even after following all instruction correctly. I used .pbs given in starter code and mopdified it to run for my python script and required time (10 minutes). I could not visually identify any difference in .pbs file I generated and you provided. So I kept scratching my head to see where did I go wrong. Although, using pbs file given in starter code, I coukld get my python script to run.

3. **Where else did you run your job? How did the setup compare to your run on Ocelote?**

Other than UAHPC on-demand portal, I used **Google-Colab Jupyter notebook** and **Ocelote Jupyter Notebook on UAHPC**. I have added the Jupyter notebook files and output files to submission folder.

4. **What questions do you still have after doing this?**
I did set my python script to generate .csv file as output and it works when ran in VS Code, although, I couldnt find a way to figure out where it generates and save this .csv file on UAHPC directory that I have created.
